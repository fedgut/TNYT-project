          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
          far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
          potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
          infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
          force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
          for a prodigiously violent instant
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
          mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
          irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
          beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
          and drew a double box around it.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
          that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
          hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic
          time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by
          John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
          detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational
          waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart
          when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
          smoking-gun evidence of
          inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was
          correct.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
          many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of
          dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space
          and energy to science and speculation.
        </p>
        <p class="artcile">
          Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its
          hundreds of billions of
          galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
          extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless
          number
          of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
          operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
          accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first
          direct
          observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
          space-time.

          As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk mythology of
          gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another
          splitting away.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          That was where Dr. Guth came in.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it
          is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space itself
          would
          become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe
          would
          blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the
          harder
          it pushed apart.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a
          submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal
          cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of
          light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but
          the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest
          that
          inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion,
          the
          rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the
          multiverse.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any deeper into
          the past.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases everything
          that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our
          view.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the
          team, “you wind up at inflation.”
